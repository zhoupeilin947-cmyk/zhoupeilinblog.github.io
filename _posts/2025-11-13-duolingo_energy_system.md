# Duolingo Energy System: Are Free Users Being Left Out
The update to Duolingo's energy system has seriously downgraded the experience for free users, making it hard for dedicated learners to achieve their goals. New users are feeling unfairly treated, and many loyal users are leaving. So, what's next for free users? Don't worry – with FamilyPro, you can get Super Duolingo for just $9.99/year. It might just be the better option for you!
## What is the Duolingo Energy System?
On July 3, 2025, Duolingo published an article titled "Why Duolingo switched to Energy and how it helps you learn," announcing that the old heart system would be replaced by 25 units of energy. Each mistake still costs one unit of energy, and Duolingo energy system also rewards extra energy when you answer questions correctly in a row. This might sound more user-friendly for free users, right? But in practice, it's actually the opposite. Even if you don’t make mistakes, completing each exercise still consumes one unit of energy, significantly reducing the learning experience for free users. Compared to the previous heart system, this change actually shortens learning time and limits progress.
## How Does the Duolingo Energy System Work?
- Users start with 25 units of energy, and each exercise completed consumes 1 unit of energy.
- Even if you answer a question correctly, energy is still consumed; if you answer incorrectly, energy is consumed and additional energy is required to correct the mistake.
- Answering multiple questions correctly in a row can trigger random rewards to restore some energy.
- You earn 2 units of energy upon completing a lesson.
- Energy automatically restores over time, taking about a day.
- Low on energy? You can watch an ad anytime to earn some energy, or use gems to purchase an energy refill.
